Highland Cow Factory – Horns

Shared sprite rules
- Canvas size: 512×512 pixels with a fully transparent background.
- Export sprites as lossless .webp files that preserve alpha.
- Keep the cow's nose tip aligned to the default anchor at (256,256) unless a recipe overrides it.
- Maintain consistent line weight, shading, and colour palette across all parts.
- Use lowercase snake_case names with category prefixes and no spaces.

Category notes
- Horn sprites replace the horn shape while respecting the body silhouette and must leave the ears unobstructed.
- Anchor reference: align the horn base to sit symmetrically around (256,150) so tips clear the canvas edges.
- Filename format: horns_<style>.webp (for example, horns_default.webp, horns_curled.webp, horns_short.webp).
- Use smooth curves and subtle shading to match the base bodies; avoid casting shadows on other layers.
