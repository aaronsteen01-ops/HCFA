Highland Cow Factory – Head Accessories

Shared sprite rules
- Canvas size: 512×512 pixels with a fully transparent background.
- Export sprites as lossless .webp files that preserve alpha.
- Keep the cow's nose tip aligned to the default anchor at (256,256) unless a recipe overrides it.
- Maintain consistent line weight, shading, and colour palette across all parts.
- Use lowercase snake_case names with category prefixes and no spaces.

Category notes
- Head accessories include crowns, bows, hats, and headbands layered above hair and horns.
- Anchor reference: align the accessory centre over (256,150) and keep the underside flush with the fringe silhouette.
- Filename format: acc_<item>.webp (for example, acc_flower_crown.webp, acc_pastel_bow.webp, acc_wizard_hat.webp).
- Tilted variants should still balance visually and avoid clipping the canvas edges.
