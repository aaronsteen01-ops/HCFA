Highland Cow Factory – Hair

Shared sprite rules
- Canvas size: 512×512 pixels with a fully transparent background.
- Export sprites as lossless .webp files that preserve alpha.
- Keep the cow's nose tip aligned to the default anchor at (256,256) unless a recipe overrides it.
- Maintain consistent line weight, shading, and colour palette across all parts.
- Use lowercase snake_case names with category prefixes and no spaces.

Category notes
- Hair sprites cover the fringe/forelock area and should layer between horns and head accessories.
- Anchor reference: align bangs so the fringe centre sits over (256,180) and follow the face contour.
- Filename format: hair_<style>.webp (for example, hair_classic.webp, hair_braided.webp, hair_spiky.webp).
- Provide optional seasonal recolours by appending the colour (hair_classic_ginger.webp) while keeping the base style consistent.
