Highland Cow Factory – Neck Accessories

Shared sprite rules
- Canvas size: 512×512 pixels with a fully transparent background.
- Export sprites as lossless .webp files that preserve alpha.
- Keep the cow's nose tip aligned to the default anchor at (256,256) unless a recipe overrides it.
- Maintain consistent line weight, shading, and colour palette across all parts.
- Use lowercase snake_case names with category prefixes and no spaces.

Category notes
- Neck accessories include scarves, bells, necklaces, or ribbons that wrap around the throat and chest.
- Anchor reference: position the collar midpoint around (256,320) so it follows the body chest curve.
- Filename format: neck_<item>.webp (for example, neck_bell.webp, neck_tartan_scarf.webp, neck_ribbon.webp).
- Ensure accessories stay within canvas bounds and do not cover the muzzle or legs.
