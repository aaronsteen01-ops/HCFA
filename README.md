# Highland Cow Farm Adventure

A pastel, slightly-chaotic (Overcooked-style) browser game where you care for a growing herd of adorable Highland cows. Keep them happy, fluffy, and well-fed by juggling fast mini-games and daily farm tasks. Built for offline play in modern browsers.

## Core Loop (One Game Day)
1. **Morning Prep**: New day summary, herd status, unlocked items.
2. **Task Rush (Timed)**: Cows make requests (food, brushing, chasing, flowers). Player completes mini-games under time pressure.
3. **Day End**: Scores, happiness changes, unlocks (new cows, accessories, decorations).
4. **Auto-Save** to `localStorage`.

## Mini-Games (MVP)
1. **Catch the Cow**  
   - Several cows try to leave the paddock.  
   - Click/tap each runaway cow before it reaches the edge.  
   - Scales with day number (more/faster cows).

2. **Food Frenzy**  
   - Cows show a bubble (ü•ï, üçé, üåæ, ü™£).  
   - Drag & drop the correct food quickly.  
   - Overfeeding increases **Chonk** (they get cutely fatter, may move slower next day).

3. **Brush Rush**  
   - Drag a brush over ‚Äúmessy‚Äù patches until clean.  
   - Sparkles appear when fully brushed.

4. *(Planned)* **Flower Fetch**  
   - Match flower colours/shapes to cows for bonus happiness.

## Aesthetics & Audio
- **Style**: Pastel palette (pink, baby-blue, soft greens), kawaii UI (hearts, stars, sparkles).
- **Cows**: Big fluffy coats, expressive faces, cute accessories (bows, flower crowns).
- **SFX**: Soft ‚Äúmoo‚Äù, brush swish, munch, gentle ‚Äúuh-oh‚Äù beeps.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast UI option, reduced-flash toggle, captions for key SFX cues.

## Progression & Unlocks
- Start with 2 cows ‚Üí expand to 20+.
- Unlocks via milestones:  
  - **Cows** (new personalities/colours),  
  - **Accessories** (hats, bows, flower crowns),  
  - **Decor** (pink barn, rainbow fence),  
  - **Foods** (cotton candy, ice cream).
- **Chonk Meter** increases with overfeeding (purely fun; small movement/animation changes only).
